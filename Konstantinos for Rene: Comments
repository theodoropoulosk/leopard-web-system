Waterfall model:
You could add a function where students, instructors, and admins can see all the information on the system about them.
You could add a "unit testing" stage where you test each part first before connecting students, instructors, and admins together.

Incremental Development model:
You could have students registering for classes on the first version, and instructors being able to see who's on their class on the
second version. This way, you wouldn't have to connect the different classes at all until version 2.

Integrate and Configure:
I don't have any comments.
