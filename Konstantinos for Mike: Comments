Waterfall model:
I don't have any comments.

Integrate and Configure model:
You could include some ideas for where to find suitable material for our project 
and what type of material that would be (databases, GUIs of other programs).

Incremental Development model:
You could explain at which point you would add the admin class functionaity, and at which point 
would all the classes be working with each other.
